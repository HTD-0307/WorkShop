**AWS IoT Core** is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps connect IoT (Internet of Things) devices to the cloud, allowing the collection, processing, and analysis of data from these devices.
This service makes it easy to deploy IoT applications with high scalability and strong reliability.

The main features of AWS IoT Core include:

- Supports connecting and managing millions of IoT devices, from sensors, machinery to mobile devices.
- Devices can send data to AWS IoT Core via protocols such as MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), HTTP, or WebSocket. The data can then be processed and forwarded to other AWS services like AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, or S3.
- Provides the ability to manage devices, from identification, security to data protection.
- Supports strong security mechanisms like device authentication, data encryption from device to cloud, and access control for users and devices.
- Has a Rules Engine feature, allowing you to define rules to forward data to other AWS services (such as AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB) based on predefined conditions.
- Easily integrates with other services such as Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Lambda, and AWS Machine Learning for data analysis and processing.
  
With these features, AWS IoT Core becomes an ideal platform for building and deploying large-scale IoT applications.
